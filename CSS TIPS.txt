TAILWIND TIPS:
1-when we write top-1/2 this means that content will adjust half length from the top of the screen and 
  left-1/2 means from left it will cover half of the screen   
  and to bring anything in the center of the screen:" absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-[50%] -translate-y-[50%]"

2-leading-none: it means it removes extra line heights from every side of your content
3-tracking-tighter: it removes extra spaces between the letters of the word(reduce letter spacing)
4-every css property has "arbitrary values" and that are bascially the values that are extra values when you dont need the normal values example size of the text
  more than 9xl in tailwind

  The arbitrary values are written in the sqaure brackets.rounded-[10px],-ml-[20px] mr-[10px] etc

5-1-"tailwind.config.js" is very important file in case of tailwind as inside this file we can add multiple option of our choice etc.
6-try to avoid @apply in your tailwind CSS code on components because soemtimes if we want to give seprate styling in the future to components then we have write more code
7- if you are working with tailwind then "tailwind.config.js" file is very important in the files section
8-if you want to give negative margin in tailwind then 
  -my-2 (negative margin)
   my-2 (positive margin)

9-FOR GRADIENTS:
  bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-green-600

10-IF YOU WANT TO BRING SOMETHING FROM VERTCIAL TO HORIZAONTAL AND BRING IT IN CENTER:
   flex items-center justify-center

11- FOR RESPONSIVENESS TO DIFFRENT SCREENS:
    md:px-20 // md means medium screen
    lg:px-40// lg means large screen

12-for good line height use leading tag-"leading-8".

13-to hide the background width of the component we use "overflow:hidden"

14-TO GIVE TEXT COLOR IN TAILWIND:text-gray-800

15-TO GIVE SCREEN SIZE TO ANY COMPONENT OF THE SCREEN WE WRITE:
   basis-1/3(33.33%), basis-1/2(50%)
   <div className='basis-1/3 flex-1'>
     <Image className='rounded-lg object-cover' 

16-You can use any value defined in your opacity scale, or use arbitrary values if you need to deviate from your design tokens-
   text-blue-600/[.06]" where 0.6 is the opacity value 

17-I have two items that are in "Vertical" line and I want that both should come in horizontal direction side by side ....THE tailwind css property such that they both come in horizontal alignment
   "FLEX" just apply it in the parent div.

18- And if you want to give horizontal spacing between them then- space-x-4(value according to you)
   and if you want to give vertical spacing between two elements then- space-y-4(value according to you)
                          
   

 *********IF AFTER INSTALLING AND FOLLOWING THE SAME EXACT STEP TO INSTALL TAILWIND CSS even if the tailwind dosent work then 
      we have to create a "style.css" file that will convert the whole tailwind css code to a custom css code and that will run on the browser.**************

   TO CREATE THAT FILE-
   "build:css":"tailwind build src/index.css -o public/style.css"
   WE HAVE TO PASTE THIS DEPENDENCY IN THE PACKAGE.json file .

   and then run this command-"npm run build:css"
   in the terminal to create the style .css file


AND IF ALSO THERE IS NOTHING HAPPEING THEN- AFTER CREATING THIS STYLE.CSS FILE THEN CREATE THE WHOLE PROJECT AND COMPONENT AGAIN.

**************AND THERE IS ALSO ONE ISSUE THAT WHEN ALL THE DEPENDENCIES USED IN THE PROJECT ARE NOT PROPERLY INSTALLED LIKE ROUTER DOM, REACT ICONS etC OR ANY OTHER.
THEN ALSO THE TAILWIND CSS DOSENT WORK IN THE BROWSER.**************
